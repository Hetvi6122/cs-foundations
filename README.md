# CS Foundations 🧮

A collection of fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in Python.  
This repository focuses on building efficient, well-documented, and modular code to strengthen problem-solving and computational thinking skills.

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- Arrays & Linked Lists  
- Stacks & Queues  
- Recursion & Backtracking  
- Searching & Sorting  
- Trees & Graphs  
- Dynamic Programming  

## 🔧 Tools
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git / GitHub

## 🎯 Goal
To master the building blocks of computer science and develop clean, efficient code foundations for AI and advanced computing applications.

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Add implementations for Arrays and Linked Lists
- Include Jupyter notebooks for explanation and visualization
- Document time and space complexity for each algorithm

## 🧩 Implemented Topics
